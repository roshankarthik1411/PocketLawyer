   • Adding “compulsory” service charges without clear consent.
   • Printing a new higher MRP sticker over the old one without valid reason.

3. Your response
   • Politely point out the printed MRP or menu price.
   • Ask for an itemised bill.
   • If they still overcharge, keep the bill and note shop details.

4. Reporting
   • File a complaint with the Legal Metrology Department or local consumer forum.
   • Use consumer helplines and online portals where available.

Overcharging on MRP is not a small favour; it is a violation of consumer law.

SERVICE-RELATED PROBLEMS – FULL DETAILS

1. Common issues
   • Hotel or PG not matching what was promised in photos or listing.
   • Salons or clinics giving poor quality or harmful service.
   • Mechanics or repair shops overcharging or doing unnecessary work.
   • Internet, coaching or subscription services not delivering as promised.

2. Right to clear information
   • Prices, taxes and terms should be explained before you commit.
   • Written estimates are ideal for big repairs or packages.

3. If service is defective
   • Explain the problem calmly and request correction or partial refund.
   • Keep bills, agreements and any promotional material that promised certain quality.

4. Escalation
   • Write to the business owner or head office.
   • If nothing changes, file a complaint with consumer forum or online portal.
   • For large chains, social media plus formal complaint can push quick resolution.

The same Consumer Protection Act that covers goods also protects you from poor services, misleading advertisements and unfair practices.
